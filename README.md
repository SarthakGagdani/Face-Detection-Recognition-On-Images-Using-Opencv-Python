# Face-Detection-Recognition-On-Images-Using-Opencv-Python

For detection of faces I used LBPH cascades in opencv as its fast and efficient.

My training data consists 12-14 images of 3 people each.

It predicted many images correctly considering small training data.If training dataset increases the accuracy will increase.

On some group photos also it had a good accuracy.

Resources-I used some suggestions from stackoverflow.

Full video with working is available on my youtube profile.
